# Official Mastodon Profiles

This repository has been created with the following premises:

1. Find accounts according to interests, categories or countries.
2. Ensure that the account officially represents the person, company or organization.
3. Improve the visibility of official accounts.

If you want to collaborate in the repository you can do it, the most important thing is that it is collaborative. If you are not a GitHub user you can contact jmrplens to send him the changes you want to propose, although it is preferable to request them in the repository through ISSUES (if it is a simple proposal) or PULL REQUEST if you make the edition directly.

The list is open to:

- Modification of existing data (errors, adding information, etc).
- Propose improvements: change the way data is organized, add or remove columns from the tables, ...
- Create new folders or new files.
- Other changes that have not yet been foreseen.
